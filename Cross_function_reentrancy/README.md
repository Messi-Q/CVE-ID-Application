# Cross_function_reentrancy

## Vendor
Cross-function Reentrancy

## Vulnerability Type
Cross Function Reentrancy Bug

## Abstract
We found a complex but common cross-function attack scenario in Ethereum smart contracts, where an attacker can undesirably reenter a function to steal money. The attack scenario can be abstracted as: (1) given a contract *Vulnerable* containing two transfer functions *getBnus* and *withdraw*, which can transfer Ether (cryptocurrency in Ethreum) to another contract. (2) Once function *getBnus* of contract Vulnerable is called to send some Ether to a contract Attacker, the *fallback* function of *Attacker* is automatically invoked. (3) In its *fallback* function, *Attacker* calls function *withdraw*, which will undesirably transfer money to *Attacker* again. While reentrancy exploiting one single function has been well studied, reentrancy vulnerability using cross-function has not yet been issued.

## Details
We present the specific steps for a specific reentry attack as shown in the figure below.
